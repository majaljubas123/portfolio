## About me

I am a motivated and versatile individual with a Master's degree in Traffic Engineering and a background in sales and project management. With a strong desire to transition to a career in software quality assurance engineering, I have taken the initiative to become certified as a Tester Foundation Level by ISTQB and completed a basic internship in manual and automation testing. 

My skills in problem-solving, analytical thinking, and attention to detail, along with my ability to communicate effectively, make me well-suited for this new career path. I am enthusiastic about applying my skills and experience to contribute to the development of high-quality software products.
